# FBLA-Computer-Game-and-Simulation-Programming-2018
Competition for Computer Game Simulation Programming for FBLA

This repository contains all the data included for the Unity project used to make the game.

Inside the builds folder, you will find the .exe file, the data folder, and the credits for the game. You can download the zip folder (which contains everything listed above) and play the game.

The "scripts" folder under the "assets" folder is where all of the code that was written is located. Most of the other folder simply contain assets that were used in the Unity game engine.

There is a Visual Studio Solution in the main folder for viewing as well.

To play the game you will walk around the city completing service-oriented tasks as an FBLA would do. Use the ARROW KEYS or the "W", "A", "S", and "D" keys to move around.

Look for YELLOW EXCLAMATION MARKS around the city and walk into them to begin each quest. PINK EXCLAMATION MARKS around the city indicate an optional side quest, walk into these to begin a side quest. The bottom right UI will contain helpful details about each quest. Also, GREEN ARROWS will help guide you through the quest.

Once you have read the instructions for the quest and completed it, go find the next exclamation mark!

Thank you!
